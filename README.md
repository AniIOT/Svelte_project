# Svelte_project
Here you will find a simple application made using svelte that has an interactive rectangular box that can be dragged across the window.
The co-ordinates of the box are also displayed at the top.

You will find two parts of code in the source code.
<!-- Ordered List -->
1. JavaScript
   This part has all the variable declarations and the event handlers.
   The event handlers will detect a mouse click and the motion of the mouse. As the handlers are a child of the box class, they will only be called if a mouse button press is detected inside the box. 
3. HTML
